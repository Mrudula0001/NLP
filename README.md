**Movie Similarity Analysis Using NLP**

**Problem Statement**

Recommending similar movies based on user preferences is a key challenge in the entertainment industry. Traditional recommendation systems often rely on metadata such as genre, director, and actors, which may not fully capture the thematic depth of a movie. This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie plots and identify similarities between films. By processing textual descriptions, this system provides more nuanced recommendations that align with the story and thematic elements rather than just categorical tags.

**Overview**

This project uses NLP techniques to compute movie similarity based on their plot summaries. It employs various text-processing and machine-learning techniques, such as:

Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization)
TF-IDF Vectorization
Cosine Similarity for measuring movie similarity

The dataset consists of movie plot summaries and metadata, which are processed to find relationships between different films.


**Features**

Movie Plot Processing: Extracts and cleans plot summaries to prepare them for analysis.
Similarity Computation: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure how similar movies are based on their plots.
Recommendation System: Suggests movies with similar narratives based on user input.
Visualization: Displays similarity scores in an intuitive manner (e.g., heatmaps, network graphs).


**Technologies Used**

Python
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)


**Usage**

Dataset Preparation: Ensure the dataset containing movie plots is in the correct format (CSV).
Preprocessing: Run the script to clean and vectorize the text data.
Similarity Calculation: The system computes similarity scores using cosine similarity.
Query Similar Movies: Input a movie title, and the system will return a list of the most similar movies.
